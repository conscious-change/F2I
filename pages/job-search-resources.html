        "After 15 years at DOE, I wanted to join the private sector clean energy revolution. I created a targeted list of 20 companies, researched their leadership teams, and found LinkedIn connections to 12 of them. Through these connections, I secured five informational interviews, which led to two formal job interviews. I ultimately received an offer from a fast-growing clean energy startup that valued my regulatory knowledge and industry relationships."
