        <li>
          <strong>Focus on achievements, not just responsibilities</strong>
          <p>Quantify your accomplishments and highlight the impact of your work. Instead of "Managed a team of 10 analysts," try "Led a team of 10 analysts that reduced processing time by 30%, saving $500,000 annually."</p>

        <li>
          <strong>Translate government terminology</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlight transferable skills</strong>
          <p>Emphasize skills that are valuable across sectors, such as leadership, project management, stakeholder engagement, and analytical abilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be concise</strong>
          <p>Private sector resumes are typically 1-2 pages. Focus on your most relevant and impressive achievements from the past 10-15 years.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customize for each opportunity</strong>
