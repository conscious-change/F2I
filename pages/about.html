    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Why F2I Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Many federal employees possess valuable skills and experience that are highly sought after in the private sector, but often struggle with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Translating government experience into language that resonates with private sector employers</li>
      <li>Understanding the differences in workplace culture and expectations</li>
      <li>Navigating the private sector job search and interview process</li>
      <li>Building a network outside of government</li>
      <li>Negotiating compensation packages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      F2I was created to address these challenges and provide a clear pathway for federal employees looking to make the transition.
