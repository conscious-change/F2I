          F2I was founded by two long-term friends who chose different paths—one in federal government and the other in the private sector. After gaining over a decade of experience in their respective industries, the time has now come to leverage their expertise to help people transition to industry. This is especially critical given the transformative impact of Generative AI on workforce needs and the recent shifts in public service policy across the U.S. and globally. Their combined experience uniquely positions them to guide professionals navigating this rapidly evolving landscape where technological innovation and policy changes are reshaping career opportunities.
