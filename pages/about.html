    <div class="team-content">
      <div class="team-text">
        <p>
          This initiative stemmed from a personal conversation with my wife, where we discussed the challenges facing public servants amid recent mass layoffs in the public sector. We decided we needed to do something to help people who have dedicated their lives to public service transition successfully to industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          To meet today's complex challenges, industry must be equipped with professionals who bring federal service backgrounds and their unique perspectives. These individuals offer invaluable insights into critical growth areas including the ethical implementation of GenAI in the public sector, AI governance frameworks, regulatory considerations, and much more.
