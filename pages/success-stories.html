        <p>
          After 12 years with the FBI's Cyber Division, I was ready for a new challenge but worried my government experience wouldn't translate to the private sector. I spent six months preparing for the transition—updating my resume, building my LinkedIn profile, and networking with former colleagues who had made similar moves.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Biggest Challenge:</strong> Translating my classified experience into terms that resonated with private sector employers without disclosing sensitive information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Key Success Factor:</strong> I focused on the transferable skills I developed—threat analysis, incident response, team leadership, and stakeholder management—rather than specific classified projects. I also emphasized my ability to bridge technical and non-technical stakeholders, which proved extremely valuable in the corporate world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Surprising Discovery:</strong> My federal experience was actually more valuable than I anticipated. Companies were eager to bring in someone with my background in national security threats and public-private partnerships. I received four offers within two months of serious job searching.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Advice for Others:</strong> "Don't undervalue your federal experience. The skills you've developed—working within complex organizations, navigating regulations, managing limited resources—are highly transferable. Focus on translating your experience into business impact, and don't be afraid to negotiate your compensation package."
