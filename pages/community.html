          "The F2I community was instrumental in my successful transition from the EPA to environmental consulting. The mentorship program connected me with someone who had made a similar move five years earlier, and her guidance helped me avoid common pitfalls and position my experience effectively. I've now been in the private sector for two years and have become a mentor myself."

          "When I decided to leave the Department of Defense after 12 years, I felt completely lost about how to approach the private sector. The F2I community forums provided invaluable advice on everything from resume translation to salary negotiation. Even more valuable were the connections‚Äîa fellow community member referred me for a position at their company that wasn't even publicly advertised."
