# Fed 2 Industry (F2I)

A comprehensive resource platform dedicated to empowering federal employees with the knowledge, tools, and community support needed to successfully transition to rewarding careers in the private sector.

## Our Mission

Fed 2 Industry (F2I) was created to address the unique challenges faced by federal employees transitioning to the private sector. Many government professionals possess valuable skills and experience that are highly sought after in industry but struggle with:

- Translating government experience into language that resonates with private sector employers
- Understanding differences in workplace culture and expectations
- Navigating the private sector job search and interview process
- Building professional networks outside of government
- Negotiating competitive compensation packages

F2I provides a clear, structured pathway to help federal employees overcome these challenges and leverage their valuable public service experience for successful private sector careers.

- **For Industry**: Facilitating access to a valuable talent pool of experienced professionals with unique public sector perspectives
- **For Society**: Enabling the cross-pollination of ideas and approaches between public and private sectors, leading to more innovative and effective solutions to complex challenges

Our goal is to help thousands of federal employees successfully transition to the private sector, with measurable improvements in transition time, job satisfaction, and compensation outcomes.
