## Recommendations for Keeping Pages Updated
Based on my review and improvements to the site, here are my recommendations for keeping the pages updated in the future:

1. Use Jekyll Collections for Structured Content
I've already set up several collections in the _config.yml file:

Posts (_posts/): For blog articles and news updates
Resources (_resources/): For downloadable resources and guides
Job Listings (_job_listings/): For job opportunities

Success Stories (_success_stories/): For testimonials and case studies

Guides (_guides/): For step-by-step guides and tutorials

These collections provide a structured way to organize content and make it easier to maintain and update.

2. Use Markdown for Content Creation
Markdown is the ideal format for content creation because:

Simplicity: It's easy to learn and use, even for non-technical content creators

Portability: Content can be easily moved between systems

Version Control: Markdown files work well with version control systems like Git

Separation of Content and Design: Content creators can focus on writing without worrying about design

3. Implement a Content Management Workflow

Create Content Templates: I've created layout templates for different content types (posts, resources, job listings, etc.)

Use Front Matter: Each content file should include front matter (the YAML section at the top) with metadata like title, date, categories, tags, etc.

Organize by Date: For time-sensitive content like blog posts, use the Jekyll date-based naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)

Use Categories and Tags: Consistently categorize and tag content to improve organization and discoverability

4. Automate Content Updates Where Possible
RSS Feeds: Jekyll automatically generates RSS feeds for your posts
Scheduled Posts: Use the future date feature in Jekyll to schedule posts
Integration with External Services: Consider integrating with services like Zapier or IFTTT to automate content updates from external sources

5. Create a Documentation Guide
Create a documentation guide for content creators that includes:

How to create and update content using Markdown

Front matter requirements for each content type

Guidelines for categories and tags
Image requirements and optimization guidelines

Process for submitting and reviewing content

6. Implement a Review Process
Content Review: Establish a process for reviewing and approving content before publication

Quality Assurance: Check for broken links, missing images, and formatting issues
SEO Review: Ensure content follows SEO best practices

7. Regular Content Audits
Quarterly Review: Conduct regular audits of existing content to identify outdated information

Update or Archive: Update content that's still relevant but outdated, and archive content that's no longer needed

Track Performance: Monitor which content performs well and use that data to inform future content creation

8. Consider a Headless CMS for Non-Technical Users
If you have non-technical content creators who find working with Markdown and Git challenging, consider implementing a headless CMS like:

Forestry.io: A Git-based CMS that works well with Jekyll

Netlify CMS: An open-source CMS for static site generators

Contentful: A more robust headless CMS with a user-friendly interface
These systems provide a user-friendly interface for content creation while still leveraging the benefits of a static site generator like Jekyll.
