## Recommendations for Keeping Pages Updated
Based on my review and improvements to the site, here are my recommendations for keeping the pages updated in the future:

1. Use Jekyll Collections for Structured Content
I've already set up several collections in the _config.yml file:

Posts (_posts/): For blog articles and news updates
Resources (_resources/): For downloadable resources and guides
Job Listings (_job_listings/): For job opportunities

Success Stories (_success_stories/): For testimonials and case studies

Guides (_guides/): For step-by-step guides and tutorials

These collections provide a structured way to organize content and make it easier to maintain and update.

2. Use Markdown for Content Creation
Markdown is the ideal format for content creation because:

Simplicity: It's easy to learn and use, even for non-technical content creators

Portability: Content can be easily moved between systems

Version Control: Markdown files work well with version control systems like Git

Separation of Content and Design: Content creators can focus on writing without worrying about design

3. Implement a Content Management Workflow

Create Content Templates: I've created layout templates for different content types (posts, resources, job listings, etc.)

Use Front Matter: Each content file should include front matter (the YAML section at the top) with metadata like title, date, categories, tags, etc.

Organize by Date: For time-sensitive content like blog posts, use the Jekyll date-based naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)

Use Categories and Tags: Consistently categorize and tag content to improve organization and discoverability

4. Automate Content Updates Where Possible
RSS Feeds: Jekyll automatically generates RSS feeds for your posts
Scheduled Posts: Use the future date feature in Jekyll to schedule posts
Integration with External Services: Consider integrating with services like Zapier or IFTTT to automate content updates from external sources

5. Create a Documentation Guide
Create a documentation guide for content creators that includes:

How to create and update content using Markdown

Front matter requirements for each content type

Guidelines for categories and tags
Image requirements and optimization guidelines

Process for submitting and reviewing content

6. Implement a Review Process
Content Review: Establish a process for reviewing and approving content before publication

Quality Assurance: Check for broken links, missing images, and formatting issues
SEO Review: Ensure content follows SEO best practices

7. Regular Content Audits
Quarterly Review: Conduct regular audits of existing content to identify outdated information

Update or Archive: Update content that's still relevant but outdated, and archive content that's no longer needed

Track Performance: Monitor which content performs well and use that data to inform future content creation

8. Consider a Headless CMS for Non-Technical Users
If you have non-technical content creators who find working with Markdown and Git challenging, consider implementing a headless CMS like:

Forestry.io: A Git-based CMS that works well with Jekyll

Netlify CMS: An open-source CMS for static site generators

Contentful: A more robust headless CMS with a user-friendly interface
These systems provide a user-friendly interface for content creation while still leveraging the benefits of a static site generator like Jekyll.

## Footer Styling Changes

### 1. Added Container Styling for the Footer
- Added specific CSS for the `.site-footer .container` selector
- Set the same properties as the navbar container:
  - `max-width: 1200px`
  - `margin: 0 auto`
  - `padding: 0 1rem`
- This ensures that the footer content aligns perfectly with the header content

### 2. Added Left Padding to the About Section
- Added a specific style for the `.footer-section.about` selector
- Set `padding-left: 0.5rem` to ensure proper alignment of the footer title
- This subtle adjustment helps align the text with the header logo

### 3. Maintained Consistent Spacing
- Kept the footer bottom section padding consistent with the rest of the footer
- Ensured that all elements in the footer are properly aligned

### Benefits
These changes ensure that:
- **Consistent Horizontal Alignment**: The footer content now aligns perfectly with the header "Fed to Industry (F2I)" text, creating a clean, professional look.
- **Proper Container Sizing**: The footer container has the same width and padding as the header container, ensuring visual consistency throughout the site.
- **Subtle Text Alignment**: The slight left padding on the about section ensures that the text aligns properly with the header text.

## Changes Made to the Homepage
- Updated Button Text: Changed the text from "Success Stories" to "Join Our Community"
- Updated Button Link: Changed the link destination from /pages/success-stories.html to /pages/community.html

## Summary of the Interactive Self-Assessment Toolkit

I've created a simplified, interactive self-assessment toolkit based on the F2i-self-assessment markdown file. Here's what I've implemented:

## 1. HTML Structure
* Created a clean, user-friendly interface with tabbed navigation
* Broke down the assessment into 5 manageable sections:
   * Technical Skills
   * Transferable Skills
   * Achievements
   * Industry Analysis
   * Summary
* Each section contains focused subsections with appropriate input fields

## 2. JavaScript Functionality
* Implemented tab navigation to switch between sections
* Created dynamic form generation for core technical skills
* Added functionality to add new entries for agency skills and software tools
* Implemented data saving to browser's localStorage for automatic progress tracking
* Added export/import functionality to save assessment data as JSON files

## 3. Data Storage
* All assessment data is stored in a structured JSON format
* Data is automatically saved to the browser's localStorage as users complete fields
* Users can export their data to a JSON file for backup or to continue on another device
* Users can import previously saved assessment data

## 4. User Experience
* Progress tracking with a visual progress bar
* Clear section navigation
* Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
* Consistent styling that matches the rest of the website

## 5. Integration with Website
* Added the self-assessment to the main navigation under "Transition Resources"
* Created a custom layout for the assessment page
* Added custom CSS for the assessment interface

## Key Features
1. **Automatic Saving**: Users don't lose their progress if they navigate away
2. **Export/Import**: Users can save their assessment data as a file and reload it later
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback on completion progress
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes
5. **Structured Data**: All inputs are captured in a clean JSON format for potential future use

The self-assessment toolkit now provides a valuable interactive tool for federal employees to identify and translate their skills for private sector transitions, with all data captured in a structured, reusable format.
